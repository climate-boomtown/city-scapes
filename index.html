    <h2>Climate Boomtown</h2>
    <p>This project looks at how four cities—Toronto, Chicago, Zurich, and Geneva—are preparing their infrastructure for a changing climate. We’re studying both government policies and community efforts to cut carbon emissions and make vital systems like energy, water, transportation, and buildings more resilient. Unlike many studies that focus on places already hit hard by climate change, we’re turning our attention to cities in cooler regions that aren't facing immediate threats. These “climate boomtowns” may even become safe havens for people relocating due to climate impacts elsewhere. In 2025, our pilot phase will explore how these cities are planning for future challenges like rising heat and flooding. We’ll look at the different ways they imagine and prepare for climate futures—and what that means for equity and resilience. This research is supported by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and the Swiss National Science Foundation.
