  <h2>Panel Discussion in Bern – 2025</h2>
  <div class="event-text">
    <p>This panel discussion, held at the Bern Polit-Forum in Bern and hosted and moderated by the Climate Boomtown research team, brought together Lisa Mazzone, party president of GRÜNE Schweiz; Philippe Koch, delegate for housing of the city of Zurich; and Sheila Murray, Co-Founder of Community Resilience to Extreme Weather (Toronto).</p>
    <p>Together, they explored how to create livable cities in times of climate change and how to make urban infrastructure more resilient to climate challenges. The conversation focused on sustainable urban planning and civic participation, featuring insights from both Switzerland and North America.</p>
    <p>The discussion continued informally over a welcoming aperitif, where attendees engaged directly with the panelists and each other, deepening the exchange of ideas and fostering new connections around the shared challenges and opportunities of urban climate adaptation.</p>

      <h2>CIFAR HUF Meeting in Brussels – 2025</h2>
      <div class="event-text">
        <p>CIFAR’s Humanity’s Urban Future (HUF) is a global, interdisciplinary research program launched in 2023 by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. It brings together 20–40 leading scholars — including planners, social scientists, historians, and architects — in five-year terms, alongside CIFAR Azrieli Global Scholars.</p>
        <p>The program explores the core question: “What makes a good city of the future?” Key themes include urban pasts and futures, infrastructure, political divisions, climate change, and crises.</p>
        <p>Six global megacities — Calcutta, Toronto, Shanghai, Naples, Mexico City, and Kinshasa — serve as focal points for comparative research. The program aims to shape policy, planning, governance, and public discourse around equitable and sustainable urban futures.</p>
        <p>On May 19, 2025, the HUF community convened in Brussels for a working meeting to plan future gatherings and collaborative projects. The session also featured a presentation on the Climate Boomtowns research project, delivered by Roger Keil and Xuefei Ren.</p>
        <p>The meeting provided an opportunity for fellows to exchange updates, align research agendas, and integrate emerging work on urban climate resilience into HUF’s broader mission.</p>
