Note: The contrast between Pictures 2 and 3 is striking. This is because the business district was constructed before urban heat became a political priority in Geneva. It was developed by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) under a directive—issued by cantonal and federal authorities—to ensure profitability from the Pont-Rouge operation. This revenue was intended to help fund the CEVA railway line, a new cross-border rail connection inaugurated in December 2019, completing a vital link in the metropolitan region's railway network.</p>
