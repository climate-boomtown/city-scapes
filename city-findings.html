  <details>
    <summary><strong>Toronto: Clean Energy Strategy</strong><br>
    Toronto, Canada’s largest city, sits along the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario and is a hub of culture, finance, and innovation. Beyond its vibrant neighborhoods and iconic skyline, Toronto is at the forefront of urban sustainability and energy innovation.</summary>

    <p>Toronto has developed one of the most ambitious district energy systems in North America, designed to serve multiple buildings efficiently while reducing fossil fuel dependence. Central to this system is Deep Lake Water Cooling (DLWC), which draws cold water from Lake Ontario to cool downtown offices, residential towers, and public spaces. This method consumes significantly less energy than conventional air conditioning, drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs.</p>

    <p>Complementing DLWC, cogeneration facilities produce both electricity and heat from a single fuel source, maximizing energy efficiency and cutting transmission losses. These integrated systems form part of Toronto’s citywide climate strategy, which focuses not only on reducing emissions but also on enhancing air quality, reliability, and resilience across the urban environment.</p>

    <p>Toronto’s approach demonstrates how large cities can scale innovative technologies to meet climate goals while maintaining economic vitality and livability.</p>

<!--Chicago section-->
<section>
  <img src="images/chicago.jpg" alt="Climate Resilience & Equity" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; margin-bottom:1em;">  
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Chicago: Climate Resilience & Equity</strong><br>
    Chicago, located on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, is a city renowned for its architecture, cultural institutions, and diverse communities. Facing extreme weather risks, from deadly heatwaves to flooding and aging infrastructure, Chicago has taken a comprehensive, equity-focused approach to climate resilience.</summary>

    <p>Its updated 2022 Climate Action Plan emphasizes both physical and social resilience, targeting neighborhoods most affected by heat, flooding, and historic pollution. Programs such as Retrofit Chicago upgrade buildings for energy efficiency, while regional initiatives like the Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP) manage stormwater and flood risks. Federal partnerships support green jobs, renewable energy access, and sustainable development, providing additional resources for city and regional projects.</p>

    <p>Importantly, grassroots organizations—including LVEJO, CEJN, and Blacks in Green—play a central role in shaping policy, advocating for environmental justice, and ensuring that local voices are heard in city planning. By combining top-down governance with bottom-up advocacy, Chicago’s climate strategy addresses both infrastructure needs and social inequities, striving to make adaptation inclusive and responsive to the communities most at risk.</p>

<!-- Zurich section-->
<section>
  <img src="images/zurich.jpg" alt="Zurich" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; margin-bottom:1em;">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Zurich: Climate Mitigation First, Adaptation Emerging</strong><br>
    Zurich, Switzerland’s largest city, is a global financial center and a city known for its high quality of life, efficient public transport, and long-standing environmental focus. Since 2008, climate mitigation has been a central priority, beginning with the 2000-watt society initiative and later strengthened by the city’s 2022 net-zero by 2040 goal—ten years ahead of Switzerland’s national target.</summary>

    <p>Zurich has only recently begun to focus on climate adaptation, with initiatives like the 2020 heat reduction planning framework that encourages green infrastructure, strategic building orientation, increased urban tree cover, and enhanced rainwater infiltration through soil unsealing. Pilot projects have expanded these efforts, including the 2021 urban tree plan and 2023 vertical greening subsidies, promoting collaboration between public and private sectors.</p>

    <p>While Zurich faces river flooding risks, water management primarily emphasizes cooling and heat mitigation. Climate governance is largely technocratic, led by city officials and parliament members—particularly the Green Party—with limited public participation. Social equity is addressed indirectly through the preservation of affordable housing and inclusive planning, but climate justice is not a central theme, highlighting the city’s emphasis on mitigation and structured adaptation over community-driven approaches.</p>

<!-- Geneva section-->
<section>
  <img src="images/Geneve.jpg" alt="Geneva" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; margin-bottom:1em;">
  <details>
    <summary><strong>Geneva: Future-Proofing Climate Boomtowns</strong><br>
    Geneva, located at the western tip of Lake Geneva, is an international hub renowned for diplomacy, finance, and its scenic urban setting. The city faces the challenge of balancing environmental leadership with regional pressures, particularly housing demand in neighboring France.</summary>

    <p>Approximately one-third of Geneva’s workforce lives across the border, creating urban sprawl and commuting pressures, while the city has prioritized preserving greenbelts within its territory. This preservation strategy slows local development, leaving neighboring French municipalities to absorb housing demand, often incentivized through fiscal transfers. Geneva’s climate strategy has evolved from emergency response, particularly after the 2003 heatwave, to longer-term planning addressing urban heat, passive cooling, and infrastructure resilience. However, much of the city’s response remains reactive or fragmented.</p>

    <p>Heat exposure varies significantly across neighborhoods: dense, historic areas like Pâquis face higher temperatures and low tree coverage, whereas modern districts such as Pont-Rouge incorporate climate-conscious design but still lack natural cooling features like lake access or shade. Water management depends on the Seujet dam, which regulates lake outflow and coordinates river flows, sometimes creating tension with Swiss cantons and France during extreme events such as the 2023 drought.</p>

    <p>Geneva’s experience illustrates the complexity of managing climate adaptation in a densely populated, internationally connected city while trying to maintain both environmental integrity and social equity.</p>
